        and levels such as ONETheLegendOf1000 by JuNiOr202 (Level ID <e>99566839</em>)
        shouldn't be broken.</li>
        <li>Make sure you're loading Geometry Dash from the Geode launcher. You should see the "Loading loader resources" text for a brief moment on the loading screen.</li>

        question: `When will Geode be available for iOS?`,
        answer: `
        There are several issues with iOS that make it very difficult
        for Geode to work as smoothly on iOS as it does compared to other platforms
        that Geode supports, such as being unable to modify apps just before being loaded.
        More technical responses exist on GitHub
        <a ${hyperlinkCSS} href="https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode/issues/598#issuecomment-1983810283">here</a>
        and <a ${hyperlinkCSS} href="https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode/discussions/548#discussioncomment-8551752">here</a>.<br><br>
        iCreate Pro is only possible on iOS because it patches the game once, as explained on GitHub
        <a ${hyperlinkCSS} href="https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode/discussions/548#discussioncomment-9095508">here</a>.<br><br>
        Despite these barriers, there are still ongoing efforts to find a sliver of hope to get
        Geode working on iOS, with a higher priority on jailbroken iOS devices.

    {
        question: `Is Geode only available on GitHub?`,
        answer: `
        Yes.<br><br>
        As Geode is a mod loader, it is impossible to distribute Geode through app stores
        or similar platforms without violating their respective guidelines.<br><br>
        While mod loaders for other video games may exist in any given app store, Geode will
        remain on GitHub.

        question: `Will Geode use something besides C++?`,
        answer: `
        <em>No.</em><br><br>
        Much like how mods for Minecraft: Java Edition are written in Java (or Kotlin) in order
        to easily interact with the Minecraft source code, anything from Geode that
        directly interacts with Geometry Dash's C++ source code will also be written in C++.<br><br>
        Technical explanations on the difficulty in implementing
        Geode in other progamming languages can be found

        There's nothing stopping you from attempting to rewrite Geode in a different programming language,
        but the time investment necessary to make it usable for the general public outweighs any probable benefits from doing so.

        question: `What happens when GD updates?`,
        answer: `
        Windows + Android users:<br>
        Geode will be put into a forward compatibility mode.
        All of Geode's ingame features and all your installed mods will be disabled.
        Don't worry though, as Geode will still auto-update to any newly available version.<br><br>
